ideas.txt
	--...Exists, this file does not. Must accept my work as is, you will.  I had been trying out a lot of different things
	--but didn't keep an ideas file because my main script did that for me.  You can generally see the progression of my work/ideas
	--if you just go through my main python script.
===========================================================================================================
PR2_Kiripolsky_Paul.py
	--The main python script.  This is where the magic happens.
